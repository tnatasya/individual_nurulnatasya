<b>Get New Roomate</b>
<p>Have a roommate for the first time in my life such as a wonderful feeling for me. Random roommate assignment lead to to strong friendship and better interpersonal skill.Random roommate allows students to gain quick exposure to interacting with others who may not share the same background,leading to unique friendships that have the potential to continue past the college years. </P>
