<p>Hello my name is  Nurul Natasya Bt Nor Asmari. I am 21 years old. I live in Cheras Selangor and was born on 23 May 1999 at Ipoh Perak.</p><p> I am currently study for my diploma in Information Management at UiTM Rembau and currently this is my last semester. The goal I'm currently striving for is to make this world a better place to live in by starting the changes with myself. Sure, I've had bad experiences in my life too, but this is exactly what made me the way I am now. I feel even more responsibility for what I do and where I go. With all I already have, I know that I'm on the right path and I will do my best to inspire others to live the way they feel like living as well.</p>

With all the information given, I manage to have the good life and try many new things like the best skincare product and how to study effectively.

Mostly girl and boy are visiting this website because this website is general and share about skincare whereby many people concern with their skin. </p>
